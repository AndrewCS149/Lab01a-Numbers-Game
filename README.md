# Numbers Game

## Objective

This application generates an array of integers based on user input. With this user 
generated array, the application then calculates the sum of the array, then the product of
that sum and an array element. Finally, the quotient of the product and another user 
generated value is retrieved.

## Content

This Application contains the following methods:

**StartSequence**
Begins the callstack.

**Populate**
Generates an array.

**GetSum**
Gets sum of the generated array from Populate().

**GetProduct**
Gets the product of the sum from GetSum() and one of the values within the generated
array from Populate().

**GetQuotient**
Gets the quotient of the product from GetProduct() and a user selected value.
